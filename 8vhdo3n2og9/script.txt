Hey, dinner for two?
Welcome to Deiahri's proprietary dating site

Whether you're looking for something long term
or you're just here for a good time

Dinner for two probably doesn't have what you're looking for,
but feel free to look around.


First, let's get your name. Who do we have the pleasure of serving today?

<user enters their name>

Nice name. Mine is pretty nice if I do say so myself.

Anywho, users of this app connect with each other based on what they know
Whether they like your picture, your favorite spot to sleep, or maybe your search history,
they'll be able to decide whether they match with you or not based on this information.

So hang tight while I fetch your information from the local CIA repository.

<while fetching info for about 20 seconds>
Hey Siri, I NEED ALL THE INFORMATION I CAN FIND ON THIS PERSON STAT!
I wanna know where they've been, who they've talked to, what food they like to eat late on a thursday night wearing nothing but their underwear.

Alexa, I to see their need PHOTOS. Ass photos. Titty photos. Family photos. And most importantly Ass photos.

Hey, still there?
This is what information we found about you.

[Let them press okay]
We also did some background checks

Criminal check
Psychopath check
Terrorist failed

You failed the terrorism background check. Something to do with a discord channel called "the boys"
but that doesn't really matter here. Love is Love!

...

Anyways, here is where the fun stuff happens. You'll be automatically matched with people around you. 

If you like what you see, click this button to start chatting. Otherwise, press this button to decline.

Thank you for using Dinner for 2, we hope you have a fantastic time.
