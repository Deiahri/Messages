Their girlfriends want to go to a prestiegeous car meet.

Now Isaac/Confidence now need to pimp their car out as much as possible to get their girlfriend's approval.

To do this, they need to sell as much stuff as they can.

I'm thinking they go to other people's houses and try to steal as much stuff as they can.
